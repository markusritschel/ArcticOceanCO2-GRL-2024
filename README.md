This repository hosts the code for the analysis and for producing the figures in our GRL paper on Arctic Ocean pCO2.

In this project we investigate continuous fields of surface ocean pCO2 in the Arctic Oceann. 
The data stem from the MPI-SOM-FFN data product (Landschützer, 2016), which uses a feed-forward neural network to fill gaps in the field of pCO2 observations.

## Preparation

### Cloning the project to your local machine

To reproduce the project, clone this repository on your machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markusritschel/ArcticOceanCO2-GRL-2024
```

and follow the following steps.


### Setup

For most steps, there are Make targets provided (run `make` in the root directory) to get you started in the fastest possible way.
To set up the project, simply run the following commands from the main directory:

First, run

```bash
make conda-env
# followed by
make install-requirements
```

to install the required packages either via `conda` or `pip`.
Make sure that your new conda environment is active (`conda activate <env-name>`) before you run `make install-requirements`.


Then run

```bash
make src-available
```

to make the project's routines (located in `src`) available for import.

Finally, you can run

```bash
make tests
```

to run the tests via `pytest` (this is optional but ensures that the code runs).

> [!NOTE]
> If you experience that something is not working (e.g. creating the documentation via `make documentation`) try to perform an update via `mamba update --all`. This might solve the problem.


### Make data available

Next, make the data available or accessible under `data/` (see project structure below and details in the documentation).
If the project is dealing with large amounts of data that reside somewhere outside your home directory,
I would suggest that you link the respective subdirectories inside `data/`.
The Python scripts should be able to follow symlinks.


## Re-creating the figures from the paper
The figures from the paper can be created by running the respective scripts in the `scripts/` directory. 
Make sure that the data are made available as described in the previous section.



## Tips

### Plotting

To make your plots look more uniform, use a style sheet and apply it to all your plotting scripts.
In the `./assets/mpl_styles/` directory, you find two basic style sheets that you can use as a starting point.
More information on how to use style sheets can be found in the [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html).
Matplotlib also provides [a set of default stylesheets](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html), which you can also use.
At the beginning of your plotting script, add the following lines:

```python
from arcticoceanco2_grl_2024 import BASE_DIR
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use(BASE_DIR/'assets/mpl_styles/white_paper.mplstyle')
```
